<p>The make utility  will determine automatically which pieces of a large program need to be recompiled, and issue the commands to recompile
 them.  The manual describes the GNU implementation of make, which was written by Richard Stallman and  Roland  McGrath,  and  is  currently
 maintained  by  Paul  Smith. Our examples show C programs, since they are very common, but you can use make with any programming language
 whose compiler can be run with a shell command.  In fact, make is not limited to programs.  You can use it to describe any task where  some
 files must be updated automatically from others whenever the others change.
</p>

<p>To  prepare  to  use  make, you must write a file called the makefile that describes the relationships among files in your program, and the
 states the commands for updating each file.  In a program, typically the executable file is updated from object files, which  are  in  turn
 made by compiling source files.
</p>
Once a suitable makefile exists, each time you change some source files, this simple shell command:

<pre>	make</pre>

<p>suffices  to  perform  all necessary recompilations.  The make program uses the makefile description and the last-modification times of the
files to decide which of the files need to be updated.  For each of those files, it issues the commands recorded in the makefile.</p>

<p>
make executes commands in the makefile to update one or more target names, where name is typically a program.  If no -f option is  present,
make will look for the makefiles GNUmakefile, makefile, and Makefile, in that order.
</p>

<p>
Normally  you should call your makefile either makefile or Makefile.  (We recommend Makefile because it appears prominently near the beginning of a directory listing, right near other important files such as README.)  The first name checked, GNUmakefile, is not recommended for most makefiles.  You should use this name if you have a makefile that is specific to GNU make, and will not be understood by other versions of make.  If makefile is '-', the standard input is read.
</p>

<p>
make updates a target if it depends on prerequisite files that have been modified since the target was last modified, or if the target does
not exist.
